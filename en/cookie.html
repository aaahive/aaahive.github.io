    company having its address at 2e Delistraat 8, Utrecht. AAAHive, registered in the Trade
    registry of the Chamber of Commerce with the number 93008341. This cookie policy explains
    how we use cookies and how we share and protect your data in relation to our website

    compliable with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the Dutch
    telecommunication law and all other relevant which is in effect at this moment.
</p>
<h2 class="cs-title">What are cookies?</h2>
<p class="cs-text">
    Cookies are small text files placed on your computer, tablet or mobile phone when you use the
    Service. Cookies are not capable or harming your computer, tablet or mobile phone. Cookies
    are needed to be able to provide you with a smooth functioning Service. We use three types of
    cookies, namely functional cookies, analytical cookies and tracking cookies. However, we will
    only use the tracking cookies with your consent. When you do not consent to the use of
    tracking cookies, the Service will work less smoothly as with tracking cookies.
</p>
<h2 class="cs-title">Functional cookies</h2>
<p class="cs-text">
    Functional cookies are cookies that are essential for the functioning of the Service. Without
    these cookies, the Service is unable to function properly. This means that these cookies cannot
    be turned off. There is a difference between session functional cookies and permanent
    functional cookies. The session cookies are deleted after you have left the Service. The
    permanent cookies are saved to prevent you from having to perform the same action all over
    again. An example of the use of permanent cookies are purchases which you have saved in
    your cart on a shopping website. We do not share the information obtained with these cookies
    with third parties.
</p>
<h2 class="cs-title">Analytical cookies</h2>
<p class="cs-text">
    Analytical cookies are cookies which are needed for the good functioning of the Service.
    Thanks to analytical cookies, we know what people search for on the Service, how long it takes
    before a page has been loaded and what buttons are pressed by people visiting the Service.
    Some analytical cookies may be placed without your consent. Other analytical cookies are only
    placed when we have your consent to do so.
    We use the following analytical cookies when providing our Service: Umami.

    cookies on the Service. We cannot influence this process. Please read the respective social
    network’s privacy policy to see how these companies treat your (personal) data and please
    beware that these policies are open to change. The information which is obtained by these
    social networks is anonymized as much as possible. Companies as LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook
    and Google+ comply with the Privacy Shield Principles and are a member of the Privacy
    Shield-program from the American Ministry of Commerce. This means that there is an
    appropriate level of protection as described in the GDPR.
